## How to run dev
We use live-server to run statically.
1. `npm i -g live-server`
2. `live-server`
3. Then if you go to the specified link in the terminal, or `localhost:8080` you can find the site.

## TODO:
- [ ] Create the data structure for the individual videos.
- [ ] Add icons for: play pause, next song, previous song, library, playlist, add song to library (plus icon?)
- [x] Decide on font
- [x] Decide on color scheme (make sure to add it to this doc or as a comment on the `styles.css`)
